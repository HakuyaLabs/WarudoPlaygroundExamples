# Warudo Playground Sample Project

This sample project showcases the Warudo Playground feature, which enables on-the-fly compilation and reloading of custom C# assets, nodes, and plugin types.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository into `Warudo/Warudo_Data/StreamingAssets/Playground`. Open the `.csproj` file (or the `Playground` folder) using your preferred IDE, and begin experimenting!

Any modifications made to C# files within the `Playground` folder will be instantly reloaded in Warudo. A popup will appear at the bottom of the screen to inform you whether the compilation was successful. If necessary, you can click on the popup to view the error stacktrace. Additionally, Warudo's log file (`%USERPROFILE%/AppData/LocalLow/HakuyaLabs/Warudo/Player.log`) is a helpful resource for troubleshooting.
